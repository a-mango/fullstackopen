# ðŸ“ž Phonebook Backend

## Introduction

In this section we will learn to implement server-side functionnalities with node.js. The goal of the course is to code a backend that will work with the phonebook application from part 2. For the sake of simplicity (or not...), the phonebook application is written and refactored in this repository and then copied to [it's own repo on github](https://github.com/a-mango/phonebook) before being deployed to Heroku.
